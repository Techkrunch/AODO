                        I worked closely with AODA Canada and it’s team for over
                        a year. Harpal and his team implemented solutions which
                        involved ensuring that all parties to the project both
                        internal to Moody’s and our external partner were able
                        to deliver their parts of the implementation. Harpal was
                        integral to the success of the project which was
                        delivered within expected timelines and to quality
                        standards. Not only did he provide excellent project
                        management skills and help our developers to comply with
                        AODA Web Implementation, carefully tracking and
                        monitoring the progress of all parties and
                        diplomatically keeping everyone on track, he brought
                        tremendous knowledge of the Web2.0 business, helping
                        with problem solving and making many valuable
                        suggestions along the way. <br />

                        knowledge made him a significant partner and support for
                        the development of my business. The little gem has
                        become an accomplished professional with very strong
                        communication skills and willingness to make things
                        happen. Harpal never see a problem as a problem but he
                        would rather just focus on the solution making you feel
                        so secure about the outcome. He always comes up with new
                        and fresh ideas and do not hesitate to lift you up in
                        case you need a boost of motivation. It is always a
                        great pleasure to connect and collaborate with him. I
                        strongly recommend Harpal for any project related to
                        website compliance and AODA solution and many other IT
                        related project. Thank you Harpal for our rich
                        collaboration and thank you for being so generous in
                        your work."
